pmstat - Viewer
===============

This repository contains a simple XUL application which can present some of
the information collectoed by the pmfstat_collector / pmfstat_server.

Installation in the current form need at least a file auth.php which does
whatever is needed for user authorization (might be empty if no auth is needed
or show an HTML form and check the settings, or ...). Database configuration
has to be done in init.php, currently.

As the XUL interface doesn'z work with the latest version of Firefox a simple
HTML-based report which is missing some features and layout was added as
index.php. http://github.com/pmfstat/pmfstat also contains a branch "dojo"
which is an old attempt to recreate the XUL interface using JavaScript and
dojo.
